# CTDSchema

Common Tool Descriptors (CTDs for short) are XML documents that represent the inputs, outputs, parameters of tools in a platform-independent way.

Once a tool is represented in a CTD, it can then be imported into different workflow systems, such as [Galaxy], [KNIME].

See the [samples] folder for further information.
